Being a writer is rough. Mostly because of the insecurities. Also, because you tend to critique yourself as you go, rewrite things, trash them, write something you didn't mean to, and more often than not, get so frustrated that you have to stop. I've stopped writing many times. And that sucks. I don't actually want to stop.

So I'm just going to write. It will be terrible. Awful. Maybe even beautiful. Hopefully, writing without those boundaries I put on myself, like the ones I constantly try to break free of in the rest of my life, will start me on a better path.

Welcome!
